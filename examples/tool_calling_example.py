Example of tool calling with OpenAI-Compatible API Mimic.

This script demonstrates how to use the function/tool calling capability
with the OpenAI-Compatible API Mimic, allowing AI models to invoke functions.

Prerequisites:
- OpenAI-Compatible API Mimic running on http://localhost:8000
- Required packages: openai, requests
